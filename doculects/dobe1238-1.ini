[notes]
The phone [k] only appears before [a] and its unstressed variant [ə], and there only in a single-digit number of morphemes.

/d r/ are alveolar; /t s l n/ are dental.

Syllabic nasals occur word-initially in one morpheme each: /n̩ˈda/ 'no' (contracted from /naʔuˈda/), /m̩-/ 2SG verbal prefix.

The Warjukur dialect has /g/ for /ŋ/ and [ŋ] for word-final /n/. The Kobror dialect has /h/ for /ŋ/.

[phonotactics]
max_initial = 1

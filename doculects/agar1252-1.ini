[notes]
Vowel nasalization is in complementary distribution with the two nasal consonants, but Goddard analyzes it as phonemic.
Long vowels occur, but they're analyzed as sequences of identical vowels.

Only nasals and the glottal stop can precede another consonant; nasals can only be followed by (homorganic?) voiceless stops.

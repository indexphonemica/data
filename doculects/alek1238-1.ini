[notes]
/w/ is found only in the village name Wanima and its derivations, and in "Pidgin loanwords".

Rather than listing the glottal stop as a consonant, Deibler lists a complete series of "vowels with glottal closure" and notes that this glottal vowel closure was previously described as a consonant. These are notated here as glottalized vowels.

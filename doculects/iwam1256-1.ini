[notes] 
Glottolog lists this source as "Iwam unclear which one probably iwam1256". 
/ɾ̃/ is described in the source as a velar nasal /ŋ/  with an "alveolar flap [n̆]" allophone that appears initially and intervocalically but not finally, but taking the word-final allophone as the underlying form is maybe a stretch.
Vowels are usually nasalized when adjacent to nasals and "frequently initially and finally", but this type of rule is difficult to enter into the current system. TODO

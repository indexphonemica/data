[notes]
Palatal finals are realized with preceding [j] offglides. 

The voiceless sonorants are given as aspirates; it's unclear whether they have positive VOT.

Presyllables are ʔa, a placeless syllabic nasal, and an unaspirated, unimploded obstruent + ə + a liquid or /n/.

There's some allophonic tone stuff.

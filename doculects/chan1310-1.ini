[notes]
The following vowel + offglide sequences appear: /iw ew ʌw aw ey ʌy ay oy uy/. These are considered to be VC sequences here.

"Retroflex consonants are heard very occasionally in a few Nepali borrowings", but it isn't mentioned which.

The source analysis has, instead of breathy-voiced vowels, an almost complete series of breathy-voiced plosives, with the only gaps being */ŋʱ pʰʱ tsʰʱ/. (A complete series of breathy nasal vowels is assumed on the evidence of the particle /nĩ̤/ and the absence of anything in the text saying they don't occur.)

[notes]
"While positing the voiceless plosives as the underlying phonemes is consistent with language universals, it is contrary to Greenberg’s prediction (1966:71) that the most frequent allophone is probably the underlying phoneme." And the plosives can occur voiced word-initially, although only at a rate of 29% for /p t/ and 18% for /k/.

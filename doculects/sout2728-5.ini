[notes]
As usual, we assume /j w/ instead of rising diphthongs. This is a little more difficult for Longxi Qiang, because both /iua/ and /ya/ exist, but /ya/ only appears after the ɕ-series, and this grammar contains no examples of /ua/ (or /ue/; /ye/ is also listed, with the same restricted distribution) following that series.

[notes]
Consonant clusters are p k b f v + ɽ and "all non-back consonants" + ɣ. Clouse says that /v f z ɣ/ may really be prevocalic /bi pi di ki/, since these sequences do not occur. 

According to sil16:31214, Duvle has "the rare three consonant sequence [kwr] which may be analyzed as [kur] or [kwr]. Duvle has written these as the former". If Duvle is like Obokuitai in this respect, it's difficult to see the advantage of this analysis, and it may be reasonable to recognize /kʷ/. In Doutai, however, McAllister & McAllister report that /u/ may be realized as [w] even in word-initial preconsonantal position (e.g. /udidiwa/ [wririwa]) and consonant clusters often take an intervening schwa (e.g. /gdaso/ [gəraso]). Given that, in the potentially comparable situation of Sikaritai (sika1263-1) Cik > Cɣ, the lost vowel still bears tone, an analysis under which all true vowels bear tone seems attractive.

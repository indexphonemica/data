[notes]
In addition to the three tones, there's also a neutral tone which can occur in affixes.

Finals are /n ŋ/.

Initial clusters are C(j)(w)V. This is not Li's analysis, but we prefer to avoid rising diphthongs. It's unclear to what extent Cjw- can occur.

It's also unclear what the distinction is between /ɬ l̥ʰ/ <ɬ lh>.

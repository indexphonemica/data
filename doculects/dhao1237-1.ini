[notes]
/ɦ|ʕ/ is given as /ʁ/, but described as "articulated by some speakers as a pharyngeal
constriction to a vowel onset, and by other speakers as a lack of a glottal stop onset (contrasting with a glottal stop onset) to a vowel-initial word in a phrase". 

Consonants are geminated after a "stressed schwa in a VCV# sequence"..

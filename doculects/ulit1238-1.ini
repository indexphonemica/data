Geminates are present and may occur word-initially, unlike consonant clusters, but no details are given. 

[todo]
(TODO: geminates? or at least add a more detailed phonology - it's also mentioned that vowel allophony exists, but no detail is given)

also check that l is actually velarized; was l_e and we did a lazy find and replace

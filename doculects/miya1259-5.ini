[notes]
The presentation is confusing and the analysis likely has room for improvement. 

Allowed clusters are /mj kj 'w/. It's unclear what the apostrophe represents. (Null initial?) /mj/ appears in two words; /kj/ appears in one.

Sequences of equivalent vowels may contrast with long vowels: /ku'usɨ/ [kuusɨ] vs. /kuuN/ [kuuŋ].

Ungeminated /s/ rarely appears before vowels other than /u/. /ts dz/ only appear before /u/.

Contrastive pitch accent (word tone?) exists, but details are unclear.

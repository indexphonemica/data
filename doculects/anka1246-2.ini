[notes]
VV and VVV nuclei are listed in addition to the four diphthongs given, but the only VVV nuclei listed (/ioɑ/ and /iɑu/) contain one of the four diphthongs.

/t/ should probably be listed as ({t}), as per anka1246-1; the only cases of non-initial /t/ in the sample text are <Pitaoyá> and <Pitaomɨ> < Eng. _Peter_.

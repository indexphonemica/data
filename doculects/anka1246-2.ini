[notes]
Only four diphthongs are listed in the inventory, but more diphthongs and triphthongs are given in the chart of syllable patterns. It's unclear which diphthongs and triphthongs are really present, so all diphthongs and triphthongs are omitted here.

/t/ should probably be listed as ({t}), as per anka1246-1; the only cases of non-initial /t/ in the sample text are <Pitaoyá> and <Pitaomɨ> < Eng. _Peter_.

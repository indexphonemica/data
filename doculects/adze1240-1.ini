[notes]
The prenasalized glottal stop is realized [ŋʔ]. The degree of aspiration in the voiceless series varies by dialect. Very little allophonic information is given.

Maximum syllable structure is C(r|w)VC, but most -C can only occur word-finally; the only word-medial C.C clusters mentioned are /ŋb mw ŋw/.

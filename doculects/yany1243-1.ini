[notes]
Prenasalized stops are presumably voiced, although they're given as /ⁿt/ etc.

Note the contrast between alveolopalatals and dorsal palatovelars - these are given as /c ʲk/ etc. Since alveolopalatals and palatovelars contrast in Yanyuwa, IPA should represent them with different series of symbols; since it doesn't, we use the Sinological dedicated alveolopalatal symbols for the former and reserve the IPA symbols for the latter.

[notes]
"Initially before a vowel, [/b/] seems for some time to have been in free variation with a sound approaching a voiced labiodental nasal and was recorded occasionally as m." Maybe a prenasalized stop? These are uncommon in the region, but /b/ is from *m.

Long vowels aren't given in the inventory, but are discussed elsewhere.

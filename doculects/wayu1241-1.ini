[notes]
Velars become bilabials after a bilabial final in close juncture. Nasal finals are realized as vowel length and nasality before homorganic stop initials, and deleted, leaving "a distinctively short vowel", before homorganic nasal initials. The final /t/ is deleted before /s tsʰ/, leaving "a distinctively short vowel".

[notes]
Preglottalized consonants, which can only appear word-initially, are analyzed as /ʔC/ sequences here, but it seems better for comparative purposes to assign each one phonemic value. It's unclear which preglottalized consonants exist, however; here we assume the same inventory as our guess for sout2954-1, which provides a little more information.

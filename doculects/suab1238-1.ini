[notes]
Glottolog lists two languages for the Inanwatan family, Duriankere and Suabo. De Vries writes that "[t]he Inanwatan family has two member languages, Inanwatan and Duriankari (also spelled Duriankere)", and says that it's doubtful whether Duriankari still exists. 

De Vries has /m n/ as the underlying forms, but [m n] only occur word-initially, so we give these as /w r/. 

Stress is phonemic.

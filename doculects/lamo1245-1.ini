[notes]
Few details are given. "Prenasalisation (voiced)" - only on voiced plosives and affricates? (But there's an example of /ⁿtʰ/.) Preaspiration occurs, but on what? 

Syllable structure is C(G)V, or (h)C(G)V if we assume preaspiration is clusterous. Which we may as well, since a complete inventory isn't given.

[notes]
In open syllables, all five tones occur; in closed syllables, only low and high tones occur. Tone sandhi is not described here.

Syllable structure is unclear. We assume that, as in Mandarin, the diphthongs are to be treated as CV/VC sequences.

An inventory of nasal vowels doesn't seem to be given. Wikipedia says all vowels but /o/ can be nasalized.

[notes]
There are five basic tones and a marginal sixth tone, but a high number of "tonal variants" triggered by particular morphosyntactic contexts, particularly marking the genitive and locative of nouns and the negative, imperative, and irrealis for verbs. We assume here that these are phonemic.

"In most cases where [*u] has remained _u_ ... it has led to labialization of the immediately preceding consonant, and this labialization has further evolved into frication approximating _v_ or _f_ ... this frication carries over into the vowel, yielding something quite distinct from a simple affricate. Even with only about two dozen instances _without_ this frication, there are a handful of minimal pairs which show this distinction to have been phonemicized ... but exactly what phonemes should be recognized is problematic." Peterson settles on ignoring it; here we assume /ꭒ/ contrasting with a marginal /u/.

A labial-velar nasal "occasionally occurs as a variant of a syllable final velar nasal reflecting an etymological bilabial nasal"; we also assume this is phonemic. 

The only possible final consonants are /ŋ ŋm/.

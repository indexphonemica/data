[notes]
The retroflex stops are given as ʈʵ ʈʵʰ. In _Grammaticalization processes in the languages of South Asia_, Coupe describes these as "retroflex plosive phoneme[s] with a rhotacized release", and in "Why are Tibeto-Burman languages so typologically diverse?" (also the source of the vowel and tone inventories presented here, although there Sangtam is given with /z/ and no glottal stop), he presents palatograms demonstrating that they have a sub-laminal active articulator.

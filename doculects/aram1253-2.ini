[notes]
No information is given about the pronunciation of orthographic <á é>. I've filled in the values from the Organised Phonology Data: <á> /a/, as opposed to <a> /ʌ/, and <é> /æ/.

<dj> is stated to be a "voiced postalveolar fricative", but this is assumed to be an affricate here, based on the spelling.

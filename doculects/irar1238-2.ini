[notes]
The palatal stops are mentioned to be close in articulation to [tʃ dʒ], with "mildly fricated release", but pattern with stops - /ȶ ⁿȡ/ seem more fitting.

"In casual speech there is a generous amount of overlap, among the three palatal vowels, i.e., (sic) /fi/ [fi ~ fɪ ~ fe], and to a lesser extent, the labial vowels, e.g., /ny/ [nʏ ~ nu] 'name' and /nu/ [nu ~ nʊ] 'island'."

/ȶ/ doesn't occur in final position.

Underlying consonant clusters are extensive, but may be broken up with syllabicization of consonants or epenthetic schwa, e.g. /mtnot/ [m̩t.not], /tftfrie/ [tf.tfrie].

All word-final clusters end in /t s n r/. The only three-consonant word-final cluster is /-ntr/.

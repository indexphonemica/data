[notes]
"...among the voiced plosives, /g/ is prevoiced more noticeably than /d̪/ or /b/. As for the voiceless plosives, /p/ is realized with more aspiration than /t̪/, /k/, or /q/."

/ɵ/ is placed at the same height as /ɪ ʏ ʊ/ in the vowel chart. /æ/ is slightly diphthongized, but given as a monophthong. /ii̯ uu̯/ are given as /i͡j u͡w/ in the source, but it's unclear if these are phonetically different from [i u].

Maximum syllable structure is CVCC. CC codas must be of the form C[sonorant αplace]C[-voice αplace].

[notes]
Interpretation of the source is very difficult. Rising diphthongs exist, but it's hard to tell which.

The clusters /bl ɸl/ exist. There may be more. Presumably these are to be analyzed as /bd ɸd/? In the Faia dialect, they're realized as [m ʰn].

No information on tone is given; here we assume the seemingly standard Lakes Plain four-tone system.

[todo]
Find a better source if possible and then delete this.

[notes]
Initial clusters are all of the form mC: /md mts mtsʰ mdz/. In the 31 tone, the preceding /m/ can be pronounced [p].

Segmental analysis is typically difficult. Here, as usual, we take diphthongs as CV or VC sequences (even /aɯ̯ a̠ɯ̯/), but we accept nasal vowels as units even though they are probably VC sequences with a placeless nasal C. (Nasal vowels never occur with a consonantal coda.)

Toneless syllables can occur in prefixes.

We follow the source in assuming initial vowels with prothetic glottal stop; an alternative would be to analyze the glottal stop as phonemic and a consonantal onset as obligatory.

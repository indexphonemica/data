[notes]
Geminates can occur word-initially.

A length distinction is said to exist for all consonants except /w j/. This apparently *does* apply to the rhotics. (But see pulu1242-2 -- in Elbert's grammar, the phoneme given here as a tap is described as sounding like the "American r", i.e. an approximant)

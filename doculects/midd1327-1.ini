[notes]
"/r/: [r]-[l] freely, but in verb prefixes the sound /r/ is usually realised as [l], whereas in
other instances, e.g. in kinship terms, it is usually realised as [r]. An explanation for this
is that the sets of verb prefixes are very complex and are features which are not shared
with neighbours outside the Watut, and consequently retain an original [1]. However
kinship terms are cognate with those of all the neighbours, and their realisation with the [r] allophone is a shared feature."

Holzknecht's notation doesn't distinguish between alveolar and 'palatal' (alveolopalatal?) affricates.

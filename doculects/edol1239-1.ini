[notes]
For /v/: "There are certain lexical items in which the phoneme /w/ seems to vary freely between [w] and [v]. ... There are also words like /mauio/ [mawio] 'gourd' that do not seem to evidence the same allophonic variation." /v j/ are the rarest consonants.

Syllable structure is (C)V(V).

Stress is apparently unpredictable, but no minimal pairs have been found.

Western Edolo has /n/, probably for Eastern /l/.

[todo]
Also gives tentative inventories for Kaluli, Kasua, Samo, and Huli - maybe addd these? Especially Kaluli and Kasua, which are from personal communication.

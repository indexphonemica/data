[notes]
/ʋ j h/ can't appear in coda. /ŋ/ can't appear foot-initially. Kölsch has a shift of g > ʀ / V[long -front]_ə, g > j otherwise, t d n > k g ŋ / V[long +high]_ with concomitant vowel shortening.

The tonal contrast only exists in "words whose stressed syllable contains at least two sonorant moras": Vː, VV̯, VN, Vl, or Vʀ.

The tonal analysis is difficult; the important part is that there's a contrast between tone and tonelessness.

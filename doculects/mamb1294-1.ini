[notes]
Length is neutralized in pharyngealized and laryngealized vowels. Pharyngealized vowels are realized as mid, but Anonby analyzes them as underlyingly high because they can take nasalization.

"Among most speakers, a phonological sequence which contains a preglottalized palatal semivowel followed by a nasalized and pharyngealized high vowel is pronounced as a syllabic nasalized voiced aryepiglottic trill (sometimes non-technically referred to as an epiglottal trill) with an epiglottal stop onset."

Tone is complicated.

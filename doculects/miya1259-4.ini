[notes]
The presentation is confusing and the analysis likely has room for improvement. 

Allowed clusters are /mj kj 'w/. It's unclear what the apostrophe represents. (Null initial?) /mj/ appears in two words; /kj/ appears in one.

/ɨ/ excretes a preceding [s] in most positions, so is surely better represented as /ɿ/.  

Sequences of equivalent vowels may contrast with long vowels: /ku'usɨ/ [kuusɨ] vs. /kuuN/ [kuuŋ].

Ungeminated /s/ rarely appears before vowels other than /ɿ/. /ts dz/ only appear before /ɨ u/. "The /CV/ pattern does not allow combinations of /t,d,n,r/ with /ɨ/".

Contrastive pitch accent (word tone?) exists, but details are unclear.

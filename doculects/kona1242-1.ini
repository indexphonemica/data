[notes]
Vowels reduce to schwa or zero in a syllable preceding an identical vowel. The phonetic consonant clusters [ɸɭ bɭ tɾ dɾ kɭ gɭ] are interpreted as CVC sequences, where the first V is the same as the one in the following syllable.

Vowel nasalization spreads throughout the word. Tone is also word-level. It's unclear what the difference is between "falling" and "fall-fall"; these are given here as 31 vs. 51.

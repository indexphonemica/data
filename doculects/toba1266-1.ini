[notes]
"The palatal stops /c/ and /j/ are remarkable in the lack of any perceptible affrication."

It's not clear if /ɸ/ and /f/ are meant to be separate phonemes, or if <f> only appears in the consonant chart as an orthographic representation of /ɸ/. The bilabial allophones of /f/ suggest the latter. But there are no other orthographic representations given in the consonant chart, so a contrast between the two is assumed here.

/t/ and /d̪/ are stated to have different POAs.

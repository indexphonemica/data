[notes]
Long vowels are given here as vowels of normal length; short vowels are given here with the extra-short diacritic.

The short vowels /e o/ only appear in the rimes [ej eʲŋ eʲk] and [ow oʷŋ oʷk] respectively, so they could also be given as ĕi ŏu. The short vowel /ɵ/ only appears in the rimes /ɵɥ ɵn ɵt/, so ɵ > ɵɥ / _# could be given as a rule instead of having /j/ round after /ɵ/. But we follow the source here. 

Initial /j w/ are "articulated with some friction".

The entering tones /55 33 22/, which only occur with a final stop, aren't included in the tone inventory here.

[todo]
(TODO: maybe these short vowels should be diphthongs again once we have better featuralization)

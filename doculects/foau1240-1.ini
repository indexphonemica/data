[notes]
Abawiri /i̝ y/ are cognate to /ɿ ꭒ/ in other Lakes Plain languages. There is no audible frication in Abawiri /i̝/.

The tone system is complicated; there are only two tones plus one floating tone (written here as /↓/), and tone contrasts with tonelessness. Here we include the tone melodies.

[todo]
How should we represent tonelessness? Figure that out and then represent the rest of the allotony rules.

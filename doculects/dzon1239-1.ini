[notes]
/pɟ pɟʰ/ have been replaced with /pc pcʰ/.

"The voiced aspirated series is pronounced either as plain voiced with a low tone or as voiceless aspirates with a low tone depending on the dialect" - so these may not truly exist. Voiced aspirate fricatives represent voiced or voiceless fricatives depending on dialect, with low tone in any case.

[todo]
Find better Dzongkha sources and replace this, or at least update it. Voiced aspirates probably don't exist.

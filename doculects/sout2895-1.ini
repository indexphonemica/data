[notes]
The geminate nasal /nn/ can occur word-initially.

The word-medial glottal stop only appears in [ˈʔeʔe] "yes". The voiced bilabial stop (which "often has an implosive quality") only occurs in [ˈamba] "where", in free variation with [p].

Stress is regularly on the penultimate syllable of the root. This causes some contrasts, e.g. [ˈosa] "one" vs. [o-ˈsa] "they climb". There are also some exceptions, e.g. [kariˈsa] "party", [ˈaikune] "beginning".

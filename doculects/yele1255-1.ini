[notes]
There are somewhere between 13 and 56 consonants, depending on analysis. We follow the source here, although it's unclear why _lv_ and _vy_ should be considered units rather than /lw wj/ clusters, or why prenasalized stops and prestopped nasals should be considered clusters rather than units.

We interpret the source's /ɣ/ as an approximant /ɰ/, since it patterns with the semivowels /j w/. 

[todo]
Eventually we'll have an abcd1234-0 series, where we pull together multiple sources into whatever seems the most reasonable analysis for the language. yele1255-0 should follow the analysis in the note.

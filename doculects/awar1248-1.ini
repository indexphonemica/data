[notes]
/ə/ is shorter than the other vowels.

/ŋ l ɣ/ can't occur initially in native words.

The voiceless series is analyzed here as aspirated because loans have a distinct unaspirated, unvoiced series (see section 10.2) - e.g. [ɛlɪsəpɛt] < _Elizabeth_, [kalapus] < _kalabus_. The voiceless labiovelar is also assumed to be aspirated.

[notes]
The only rimes that permit final consonants are /ik uk/ [ɿg ub] and diphthongs ending in /ik uk/, so these could alternately be analyzed as complex vowels.

"The high close front unrounded vocoid is backed, tense, and with friction" before syllable-final /k/.

Given the distribution of /uV/ sequences, and the evident tonelessness of /u/ between /k/ and /d/ [ɾ], we accept /kʷ/ as a seventh consonant but mark it as marginal; it's difficult to see the advantage of the /kur/ [kwr] analysis. In Doutai, however, McAllister & McAllister report that /u/ may be realized as [w] even in word-initial preconsonantal position (e.g. /udidiwa/ [wririwa]) and consonant clusters often take an intervening schwa (e.g. /gdaso/ [gəraso]). Given that, in the potentially comparable situation of Sikaritai (sika1263-1) Cik > Cɣ, the lost vowel still bears tone, an analysis under which all true vowels bear tone seems attractive.

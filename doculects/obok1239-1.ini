[notes]
The only rimes that permit final consonants are /ik uk/ [ɿg ub] and diphthongs ending in /ik uk/, so these could alternately be analyzed as complex vowels.

"The high close front unrounded vocoid is backed, tense, and with friction" before syllable-final /k/.

Given the distribution of /uV/ sequences, and the evident tonelessness of /u/ between /k/ and /d/ [ɾ], we accept /kʷ/ as a seventh consonant but mark it as marginal.

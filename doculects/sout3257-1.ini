[notes]
Glottal stops are inserted before phrase-initial vowels, and may also be inserted after phrase-final vowels.

Simplex disyllables have three surface melodies, analyzed as coming from the interaction of accent (stress) placement and a phonemic low tone.

Unaccented vowels are subject to devoicing in some unspecified environment: "low vowels are slightly devoiced; mid vowels are more devoiced than the low vowels; high vowels ... are even further reduced; schwa is often deleted entirely."

[notes]
The Mettlers don't include /kʷ/, but they note the words /ˈkwritan/ 'octopus' and /ˈikwran/ 'his tail', which suggest that /kʷ/ may be necessary.

The third consonant in a cluster must be a semivowel: /kⁿpwere/ 'bamboo rack', /sljaru/ 'maize'.

Stress is penultimate, but under certain circumstances may become ultimate.

The Mettlers claim the "voiceless alveolar-velar double stop" /kt/ as a rare unconditioned allophone of /t/, and /gb/ as a rare unconditioned allophone of /b/.

[todo]
This went uncommitted for a while - looks correct but should check later.

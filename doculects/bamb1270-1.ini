[notes]
/p t k l s h β m n ŋ/ can be geminated word-internally, and the clusters /mp nt ŋk mb nd ŋg/ also occur, but the only consonants that can occur word-finally are /k/ [ʔ] and /m/.

There are various seemingly morphophonological rules given in the source, which we don't list as allophonic rules.

A "weak glottal stop" occurs between identical vowels.

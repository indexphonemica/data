[notes]
Voiceless geminates in Aralle are realized as hC sequences in Tabulahan.

/t/ is described as a "voiceless dental plosive", but /d/ is described as a "voiceless alveolar plosive".

A "weak glottal stop" separates adjacent identical vowels.

Stress is predictable: on the penult except for distal vocatives (final), enclitics, and a + V sequences in rapid speech where V would otherwise be stressed. Stressed vowels are slightly lengthened.

[todo]
Maybe represent weak glottal stop in allophonic rules - it's phonemic in Gimi so we'll need a symbol to represent it anyway (<.>?); should also look into Samic 'glottal pulse'

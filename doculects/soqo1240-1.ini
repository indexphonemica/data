[notes]
"For many consonants (except for postalveolars, palatals, gutturals, and _ʋ_) palatalized allophones feature in the vicinity of front vowels (obligatory with _i_, and often with stressed _e_) ... Velarized _lˠ_ shifts to _l_ under the same conditions".

Voicing assimilation is regressive.

"When passive forms of the suffix conjugation in the basic and causative stems are produced from roots whose first two consonants form a cluster in the corresponding active forms, a very short _i_ is inserted between the first two radicals" - this contrasts with null, but may be underlying /i/.

The maximum permisible number of coda consonants is unclear.

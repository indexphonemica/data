[notes]
The only permissible coda is -ŋ, and this only occurs in Mandarin loanwords.

"In syllables with a nasal initial consonant, the syllable mayreduce to a syllabic nasal, e.g., NEG /ma²¹/ is often reduced to [m̩²¹],[ŋ  ̣²¹]or [n̩²¹], assimilating to the place of articulation of the initial consonantof the following syllable. ... In words with three or more syllables, syllabic nasals with a mid or high tonemay be incorporated as the coda of the preceding syllable, a post-lexicalprocess that also reassociates the reduced syllable’s tone."

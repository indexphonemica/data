[notes]
It's unclear what <dh> is supposed to be. The value given here is probably wrong.

Acutes are assumed here to represent long vowels, and å is assumed to be long. This may not be correct, but Namkung's suggested vowel inventory seems a little too large.

Nasalized vowels are noted to exist, but no inventory is given. Here it's assumed that all vowels can be nasalized.

[todo]
This is not particularly useful. The source is from 1895 and presumably presents many difficulties of interpretation.

[notes]
/xʲ/ is only present for some speakers of the Third Township dialect, and is otherwise merged into /ɕ/.

Other labialized and palatalized consonants may occur in Chinese loans. (Does this indicate that they should instead be considered clusters?)

Schwa does not occur in open syllables. 

Lengthening of /ə ɑ əi/ gives /ɑ ɔ ɑi/. No length-based minimal pairs occur in elicitation of lexical items in citation form, but vowel length has grammatical function.

Initial clusters are /pɹ bɹ mɹ kɹ gɹ xɹ pl bl ml kl gl/. Finals are /p t k ʔ m n ŋ l ɹ/; the only final clusters are nasal and glottal stop, and these are only produced "when verbs with stop codas interact with the first-person singular inflection in agentive sentences".

Some syllables - in affixes, particles, and initial syllables of disyllabic words - are toneless; toneless syllables are alternately described as having low falling tone. Syllables ending in voiceless stops bear a "checked tone" and are pronounced with a pitch similar to that of the high level tone.

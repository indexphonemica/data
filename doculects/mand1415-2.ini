[notes]
Allophonic rules are conjectural. Some of the given vowels are unlikely to be phonemic, but there's no analysis.

/ʔ ʔʰ/ are from /k kʰ/. (Is this the dialect Yuen Ren Chao wrote about? Probably not - I can't find the quote, but Colarusso says it was Hakka, whereas this is clearly Mandarin.)

Tone surely exists, but no information is given.

[notes]
Initial clusters are /ʔm ʔw ʔj kw ɸw sj tsj zj kj/. Clusters containing a glottal stop can only occur word-initially.

The vowel inventory probably also contains long vowels (maybe /eː oː/ aren't marginal, as in some other Ryukyuan languages?) and Vi diphthongs, but no comprehensive inventory is given.

[phonotactics]
max_initial = 2
max_final = 1

ɸ >~ h / _ (but ɸa and ha contrast)
h > ç / _i
h > ɸ / _u (why is this analyzed as /h/ rather than /ɸ/? "/f/ occurs at the beginning of words" - only?)

s > ʃ / _i, _j
ts > tʃ / _i, _j
z > dʒ / _i, _j

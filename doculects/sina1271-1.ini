[notes]
Not sure about these plosive lenition rules. There are additional rules that are hard to code in the current system; for example, any vowel apparently may be deleted before a sonorant, including an epenthetic semivowel. Most of the given examples of vowel deletion use /i/, however, so this is given here.

Maximal syllable structure is CCVC, but CC onsets are constrained: obstruent + sonorant, /sk/, or plosive + /b/.

p > β / V_V in syllables without primary stress
b > β / V_V in syllables without primary stress
k > ɣ / V_V in syllables without primary stress
g > ɣ / V_V in syllables without primary stress

i > 0 / in nonfinal unstressed syllables (applies after plosive lenition)
ɛ > 0 / in nonfinal unstressed syllables (applies after plosive lenition)

i+l >~ l̩ / in rapid speech
i+n >~ n̩ / in rapid speech
ɾ+ɾ > r / _ (applies after front vowel deletion)

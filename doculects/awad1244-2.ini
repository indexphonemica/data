[notes]
Copied from awad1244-1; the only difference is that the /z/ phoneme has been added, since that's the only difference noted. (Yamai is a Samang-D dialect and the dialect survey reports 99% cognates, so presumably they aren't too different.)

Samang-Z is assigned to bili1252 on the grounds that it's noted to be spoken in Biliau village.

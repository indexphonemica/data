[notes]
Loanwords dramatically expanded the Fagauvea segment inventory; the ones marked as loans here are the ones noted not to be well-integrated. The original, pre-contact inventory is given as /p t k f v s l m n ŋ a e o i u/; however, /d g/ developed endogenously and /h/ was added by Polynesian loans.

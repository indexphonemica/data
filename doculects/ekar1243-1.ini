[notes]
The Mee tonal system isn't described here; according to _On the Analysis of Tone in Mee (Ekari, Ekagi, Kapauku)_ (Hyman and Kobepa 2012, https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9dv1v7fm), there are two word-level tonal patterns, and a third that's only distinguished by alternation before enclitics. For simplicity, and since word-level tones are hard to represent in IPHON's model, these are given as two tones, ˥˩ and ˥.

"Short /i e/ are reduced and highly lateralized after [gʟ]".

[notes]
To facilitate crosslinguistic comparison, rising diphthongs are here considered to be VC sequences. /ɥ/, which only appears in /ɥe/ and the morphologically derived diphthongs /ɥeː ɥæ ɥæː/ (and their rhotacized equivalents), is added as a (marginal) consonant phoneme.

Falling diphthongs, however, are considered to be phonemes.

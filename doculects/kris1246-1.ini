[notes]
Tone is word-level. Disyllabic tone patterns are HL, LL, LH, LR, RH, RL. In monosyllables: 
- HL > F
- LL > L
- LH > R
- LR > R
- RH > H
- RL > F

Vowels have weak nasalization after /b d/ [m n] and strong nasalization following any other onset, including zero.

Initial clusters are /pd bd td sd/; these are only allowed in monosyllables. /l p/ are found in coda position only rarely, and there's one instance of coda /s/. (Coda /l p s/ were probably introduced by loans.) Otherwise, syllable structure is (C)V(j w).

Initial clusters can't appear in nasal syllables.

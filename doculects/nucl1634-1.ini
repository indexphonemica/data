[notes]
There's complicated vowel allophony depending on surrounding vowels and whether or not there's a preceding consonant. This isn't described here.

There are three phonetic degrees of nasalization: strongly nasalized (phonemic nasal vowels), weakly nasalized (produced by rightward spreading of nasality from nasal vowels or consonants, and blocked by oral consonants), and oral.

...but umlaut should probably be described at some point

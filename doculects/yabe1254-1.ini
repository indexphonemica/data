[notes]
/ɛ ɔ e o/ are "somewhat higher than the phonetic use of these symbols usually indicates".

The two syllables of a foot must agree in tone. Tone determines the voicing of plosives: in a foot with high tone, all stops are voiceless, whereas in a foot with low tone, all stops are voiced. Prenasalization is also a feature of the foot, but word-initial consonants are never prenasalized.

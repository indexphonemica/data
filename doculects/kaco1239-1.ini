[notes]
The vowel inventory is unclear.

"For many speakers, the palatal fricative is frequently realized as its more affricated allophone [tʃ], and, as an English speaker, is barely discernible from the palatal stop /c/." So presumably /c/ is a coronal affricate?

Vowels are nasalized after a nasal onset.

/ə/ in the source is given as at the same height as /ɛ/, so here it's /ɜ/.

[todo]
Should really check this later, it's not great. Should also check the stuff from that dissertation on Qiang.

[notes]
Initial clusters are of the form Cɾ, analyzed as /Cd/.

"In a limited number of words, [d] occurs word-medial and intervocalically, but is not in free variation with [l]. It also contrasts with [ř] in this environment." Martin analyzes this as contrastive syllabification: [kódá] /kód.a/ vs. [kóřɛ̀] /kóřɛ̀/. 

"[dž] occurs word initial in a limited number of words. These appear to have lost their initial syllable."

Diphthongs contrast with vowel sequences: /au.so/ 'powder' vs. /a.úd.a/ 'nest'.

On the fricated allophone of /i/: "The articulator is raised and fronted. The larynx is slightly lowered. The faucal pillars are opened (lax). The resulting phenomenon is a very high vowel with friction resulting from raising of the high vowel and breathiness resulting from the lax faucal pillars."

[notes]
"The high vowels /ɨ̝, ɿ, y, ɯ/ can be very fricated", so they're given as fricated vowels here.

/ʅ/ corresponds to Yu's /ɨ̝/, described as "like a syllabic apical alveolar fricative". This has "a slight degree of lip rounding".

Yu's /˥˥˦/ is given here as /˥˦/ for consistency.

[todo]
Toneless syllables exist - should figure out how to represent this.

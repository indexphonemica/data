[notes]
/ʔ/ only appears word-finally, where it contrasts with the "laryngealized" and "glottalized" phonations - all of /aˀ aˀa aʔ/ are contrastive.

Many consonants are partially devoiced in word-final position.

Modal vowels may optionally be long in certain contexts. Allophonic creaky vowels are also described as long, as are laryngealized vowels (/VˀV/).

Laryngealized and glottalized vowels are realized as creaky under certain contexts - I think when a consonantal suffix follows? TODO

CCC codas only occur in loans.

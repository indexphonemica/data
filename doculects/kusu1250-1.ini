[notes]
/ʕ ʕ̃/ are given as /ɢ ɴ/, but are described as being realized as pharyngeals: "In Kamala’s speech, [ɢ] and [ɴ] have virtually been lost, being replaced by compensatory pharyngealization on the preceding vowel and a lowering of pitch levels.  In fact,these are the primary auditory cues to their presence.  The presence of [ɴ] is signalled additionally by nasalization on the affected vowel.  In Gyani Maiya’s speech, the historical underpinnings for these consonants are a little easier to perceive, sometimes _almost_ surfacing in careful speech."

The 'palatal' consonants are laminal; the relevant distinction seems to be between apical and laminal. These are given here as palatoalveolars, although the source uses the IPA palatal series.

[notes]
The contrast between voiced and prenasalized stops is probably not phonemic: "There are no minimal pairs showing contrast ... [v]oiced stops appear realised with prenasalisation unless another voiced stop appears in the immediate environment. May and Loeweke decided against this analysis on the basis that it does not seem to have a phonological basis."

/t̪ s̪/ contrast only word-finally; otherwise, /s̪/ appears before high vowels.

[notes]
Western /ɜ ʌ/ correspond to eastern /ɵ æ/ from */ɵ ə/. In the eastern dialects, the reflex of */ɵ/ is [+back] and the reflex of */ə/ is not; in the western dialects, the opposite is true.

/ɲ/ is described as prepalatal rather than postalveolar.

The precise restrictions on clusters aren't specified, but they're clearly complex: /pʃtʃɔwɑ/ 'bee', /wspulnɘ/ 'common', /nɘparstk/ 'thimble', /mʃa/ 'holy mass'.

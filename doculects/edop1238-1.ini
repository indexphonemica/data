[notes]
/o ɔ/ "occur in free fluctuation with each other, though in certain words [o] is usually used, in others [ɔ] usually is, whereas in yet others both are common" - merger nearing completion? Marking /o/ as marginal. Apparently certain words (but not others) admit [ɒ] for stressed /ɔ/, so maybe the original values were /o ɒ/.

All tones vary with the mid tone except in words that are minimal pairs of tones.

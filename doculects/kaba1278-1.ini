[notes]
IPHON transcribes NWC vowels narrowly - they're higher than the conventional symbols /a ə/ indicate.

It's unclear whether the 'running man' letters (ƛ λ) represent fricatives or affricates. They typically represent affricates, but in other inventories in the source they're said to represent fricatives.

[todo]
Do the 'running man' letters represent fricatives or affricates?

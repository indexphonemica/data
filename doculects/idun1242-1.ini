[notes]

[todo]
For consistency, if we're letting them set up medials here, we really ought to go back and accept medials in ST - although that would give Qiang a few hundred vowels, which is the reason we don't accept them in the first place.

Phonemic length may exist, but only on the first syllable of trisyllabic words.

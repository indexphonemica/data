[notes]
The segments given with palatal symbols, aside from /j/, are described as coronal prepalatal, so we use the alveolopalatal symbols /ȶ ȵ/.

/ə/ only appears in unstressed syllables.

Diphthongized allophones of long mid vowels contrast with vowel + semivowel sequences: /deː/ (given as [deːʲ]) doesn't rhyme with /beːj/.

The tonal opposition is assumed to be H ('Accent 2') vs. 0 ('Accent 1'). Tonally marked diphthongs monophthongize, but do not merge: /ɦɛit2/ [ɦɛː(ʲ)t2] vs. /tɛːt1/ [tɛ̞ːt1]. Since IPHON's transcription system doesn't tolerate ʲ on vowels, these are given as ɛe̯ː etc. on the grounds that the Accent 2 diphthongs are stated not to be _purely_ monophthongal. An alternative would be to write the high-mid vowels as e̝ etc. -- raised high-mid vowels are necessary in e.g. kens1248-1 -- but they're given as near cardinal high-mid.

[notes]
/y/ is marked as marginal and /iː/ isn't, but they're both noted as having been found in only one word. /ø/ only occurs in place names.

Vowels with falling tone are longer than short vowels, but not as long as long vowels. Vowels with falling tone don't contrast for length, unlike vowels with low or high tone.

/ɦ/ has only been found word-initially before /o/.

The possible existence of a rising tone is "an unresolved issue", but it's included here.

The diphthongs /i̯u i̯uː/ could be analyzed as Cj clusters, but these clusters only appear before /u uː/. Other onset clusters are /pʰɾ pɾ bɾ pl bl/ and, in one word, /kw/.

/ea/ only occurs before a velar coda. /au/ only occurs in open syllables.

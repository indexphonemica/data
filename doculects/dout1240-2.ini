[notes]
The k/g contrast may be neutralized intervocalically, "depending on clan".

The authors interpret the fricated vowels as Vk sequences, but /k/ can seemingly only follow high vowels, and the choice of this consonant seems arbitrary.

[allophonic_rules]
b > ɓ / #_ 
d > ɗ / #_
k > q / _{a o u} (the statement of this rule is hopelessly confused, but this seems like a plausible interpretation of what was meant)
b >~ β / V_V
g >~ ɣ / V_V
k >~ g ~ ɣ / V_V
d > r ~ l / V_V

ɿ > ɿ+dʒ / _j, _V
ꭒ > ꭒ+dʒ / _j, _V

i > ɪ / {i ɿ}$_ (i.e. after a syllable containing an /i/ or an /ɿ/)

i >~ u / in some words

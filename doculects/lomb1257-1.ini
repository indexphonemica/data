[notes]
Some subvarieties have /z/ and others have /ð/.

Vowels are longer before voiced consonants than before voiceless ones.

Flapping of /t d/ 'between resonants' - presumably rather between vowels or semivowels?

Initial clusters are Pr fr hr, NP ɱf ɱv nh n̠tʃ n̠dʒ (but n is syllabic here), h + any C other than /z h ʃ/, and hPr hfr.

Final clusters are /hp ht hk htʃ mp nt ŋk ɱf n̠h n̠tʃ/ and /l r/ + /p t k f h tʃ/.

Stress is contrastive.

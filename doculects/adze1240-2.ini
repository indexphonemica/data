[notes]
Length, /ⁿdʒ/, /u/ as distinct from /o/, and voiced prenasalized stops in general are said not to be phonemic.

Diphthongs may be vowel sequences.

Maximum syllable structure is CCVC, but CC sequences other than Cr (where this C is not /ʔ ⁿʔ n w j/ or the dubious /ⁿdʒ/) occur only at morpheme boundaries or due to reduplication.

[phonotactics]
max_initial = 2
max_final = 1

/ai au/ don't occur in 'open' (i.e. neither checked nor nasal) syllables. The writing system identifies closed-syllable /au/ with open-syllable /ɔ/.

A phonemic analysis of Burmese suited to a crosslinguistic database is difficult: tone, phonation, vowel length, vowel quality, and syllable closure are all related. The analysis used here does not strictly follow the source - it takes phonation (rather than tone) to be primary, since this seems to be the simplest rendering of the inventory, and to require the least coding of rules and restrictions.

Creaky phonation correlates with high falling tone. 

Modal phonation correlates with low (or low rising phrase-finally) tone and length. 

Breathy (actually "clear, sometimes slightly lax") voicing correlates with high (or high falling phrase-finally) tone and length.

Checked phonation correlates with mid-high tone "with slight fall" and very short timing.

/ə/ only appears in minor syllables.

'Juncture' is phonologically relevant: "In citation form, or before a syllable in open juncture, the two Cfs are realized as nasalization on the vowel and final  glottal stop (plus associated tonal  features) respectively. With following  close juncture, however, the final nasal  tends to assimilate to the position of  the following Ci ... while the final stop is realized as a consonant from the plain series homorganic in both manner and place with the following Ci."

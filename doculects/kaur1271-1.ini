[notes]
Clusters are /pl ⁿbl tl kl/, and /ⁿdl/ in contracted syllables. Coda consonants are /n k l m/, but /m/ never occurs word-finally (and is apparently only a contraction of /mɛ/) and /k/ only occurs word-finally. Syllable-final /n/ is realized as nasalization on the preceding vowel.

/dʒ/ is said to be alveolar but consistently transcribed as [dž].

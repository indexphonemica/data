[notes]
Nasals in presyllable peak or coda position assimilate in place to following consonants.

A narrowly phonetic analysis is used here; a deeper analysis would assign the mid-creaky and low series +RTR.

Open presyllables can take the vowels /i a u/. Closed presyllables have no vowel contrast, and only take schwa.

Consonant clusters in native words are /kl kr pl pr tr/.

Glottalized sonorants only appear word-finally.

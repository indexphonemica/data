[notes]
kʰ is rare outside loanwords. Unaspirated plosives vary freely with ejectives. /ɲ/ appears "in certain causative verbs, word-finally before a high front vowel /i/, and in the diminutive suffix -ɲala", and in a "limited number of lexemes" elsewhere.

Prenasalized consonants are attested from a total of 21 words. It's unclear which prenasalized consonants are present. Do these prenasalized consonants contrast with sequences of the syllabic nasal and a stop? Presumably, since the syllabic nasal can bear tone and the prenasal component can't. Since the examples of prenasalized stops are voiced or aspirated, we assume all voiced or aspirated stops or affricates can be prenasalized, but this is probably not true.

Clicks are attested from around 50 words. It's unclear which clicks are present. Younger speakers tend to realize all clicks as dental. We assume a fully Cartesian inventory of clicks.

Vowels in a penultimate syllable are automatically lengthened. Do these allophonic long vowels contrast with sequences of two identical vowels?

"Falling tones only occur in the penultimate syllable ... where they are the result of penultimate lengthening", but level high tones also occur in the penultimate syllable. Is the falling tone contrastive?
